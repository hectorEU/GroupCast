Welcome to PyActor's documentation!
===================================

*The minimalistic python actor middleware*
******************************************

PyActor is a python actor middleware for an object oriented architecture
constructed with the idea of getting two remote actors
to quickly communicate in a very simple, lightweight and minimalistic way.

It supports two versions:

* Threading
* Gevent green threads


It also includes communication between machines using XMLRPC and a second version
that uses RabbitMQ message system in a transparent way.

For install instructions, see :ref:`install`.

Visit the repository at `GitHub <https://github.com/pedrotgn/pyactor>`_.

See the :ref:`tuturial` for a complete review on the features of PyActor.
And complete it with the :ref:`remote_tuto`.
